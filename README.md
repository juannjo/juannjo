### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan from Chile, i'm currently studying Web Development and making projects with technologies like JavaScript and libraries such as Bootstrap, React.js, jQuery and TailwindCSS. 
My next goal will be learn other technologies related like Next.js, Deep Cyber security, and specially Product design and UX & UI.
About me
I have some hobbies, i like to play FPS games like Apex and COD, read manga, read some sci-fi books (Neuromancer, The foundation saga, etc.), and also the coffee but just a little bit.
